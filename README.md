# Chatbot Using NLTK in Python

This project demonstrates a simple rule-based chatbot built using the **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)** in Python. It uses pattern matching to generate responses to user input and runs in an infinite loop until the user chooses to exit.

## Features

- Responds to basic user inputs with predefined patterns.
- Capable of answering questions about time, date, Python, and more.
- Simple architecture for easy customization and expansion.
- Uses NLTK's `Chat` and `reflections` utilities for natural language interaction.

## Files in This Repository

| File Name         | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `main.py`         | Main script to run the chatbot. |
| `long_responses.py` | Contains extended responses or logic if the chatbot needs more complex handling. |
| `intents.json`    | A JSON file for storing intents, patterns, and responses (ideal for future ML integration). |
| `pyvenv.cfg`      | Virtual environment configuration file. |
| `.gitignore`      | Git ignore rules for virtual environments and caches. |
| `.gitattributes`  | Git attributes for language detection and settings. |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NLTK library

Install NLTK using pip if not already installed:
```bash
pip install nltk
````

### How to Run

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Run the chatbot using:
